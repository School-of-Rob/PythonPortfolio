## 📊 Project Overview

For my very first Python project, this project explores customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to help a leading retail company understand and target their customer base more effectively. By analyzing personality, demographics, and purchase behavior, the goal is to identify actionable customer segments that can drive personalized marketing and business strategy.

---

## 🏢 Business Context

With rising competition in retail, businesses must move beyond generic strategies. Understanding customer personalities and behaviors enables:
- More effective targeted marketing campaigns
- Improved retention strategies for high-value customers
- Optimized allocation of resources (inventory, pricing, store layouts)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer data to uncover distinct personality-based segments
- Apply clustering and visualization techniques to profile each segment
- Provide actionable recommendations for marketing and customer engagement

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes historical data on customer demographics, personality traits, and purchasing behavior. Key features include:

- **Customer Info:** ID, birth year, education, marital status, income, children/teens at home, enrollment date, recency, complaints
- **Spending:** Amount spent on wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, gold products
- **Purchases:** Purchases by deals, campaign responses, web/catalog/store visits
- **Engagement:** Website visits, complaint history
